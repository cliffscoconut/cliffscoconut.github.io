I'm a data scientist with a passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'ved embraced a journey that has taken me from a 9-5 job to the challenges and freedoms of a digital nomad-an adventure beyond anything I could have imagined, but I feel it has only just begun. 

We are experiencing the natural language processing revolution. While the impact of transformer models is on the rise, I believe that we are still scratching the surface. As a student of ML and AI, I am excited to dig deeper to uncover its applications and potential.

My dedication is to lifelong learning and embracing the liberty to chart a virtuous course through this burgeoning field. I am inspired to contribute meaningfully to the unfolding narrative of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to share the journey with fellow explorers along the way.
