I'm a data scientist with a passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. I've embraced a journey that has taken me from a 9-5 job to the challenges and freedoms of a digital nomad-an adventure that has surpassed all my expectations, but I feel it has only just begun. 

We are experiencing the natural language processing revolution. As the impact of transformer model grows, I believe that we are still scratching the surface. Eager to delve deeper as a student of ML and AI, I am excited to further uncover its applications and potential.

My dedication is to lifelong learning and embracing the liberty to navigate a virtuous path through this rapidly evolving field. I am inspired to contribute meaningfully to the innovations of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to share the journey with fellow explorers along the way.
